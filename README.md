# Anchor Demo

This repo demonstrates one way to combine `apostrophe-anchors`, `apostrophe-anchor-field-type`, and a project level widget to create a navigation builder that can link to internal Apostorphe pages, external URLs, and target anchor points from either destination within the Apostrophe interface.

## `apostrophe-anchors`
Used to `improve` all existing widgets and give them an ID property that is wrapped around the widget, allowing easing anchor linking to any existing widget.

## `apostrophe-anchor-field-type`
An Apostrophe field type that can be attached to other schema fields and dynamically provide the `name` and `id` attributes existing on outside pages. Useful for targeting anchor points on pages both internal to Apostrophe and external.
